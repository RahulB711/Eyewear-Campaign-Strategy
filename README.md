# Eyewear-Campaign-Strategy
A data-driven project to optimize marketing spend across campaign segments using machine learning, simulation, and optimization.

## Problem Statement
The business wants to maximize either customer responses or revenue from marketing campaigns. Given a fixed budget of **$2M** and a mailing cost of **$0.25 per customer**, we aim to identify which segments (defined by product, milestone, month, customer group) to target to achieve the best ROI.

## Objectives
- Predict customer response probability
- Simulate ROI across response score thresholds
- Identify high-performing campaign segments
- Optimize budget allocation using linear programming
- Visualize insights and recommendations using Power BI

  ## Project Workflow
  ### Day 1: Data Understanding & Preprocessing
- Explored the dataset structure
- Identified key columns like `RESPONSE_COUNT`, `RESPONSE_SALES_AMT`
- Understood how campaign segments are defined
